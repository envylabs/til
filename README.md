# Today I Learned

Quick notes on daily discoveries relevant to the work we do. This is an attempt
to record these “minipiphanies” that don’t end up making it into blog posts or
public talks.

This was inspired by thoughtbot’s [namesake project][original], of which we
failed to come up with a better, simpler name for what we do on a daily basis.

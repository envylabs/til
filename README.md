Today I Learned
---------------

Quick notes on daily discoveries that can be code or program-related. This is an attempt to record these “minipiphanies” that don’t end up making it into blog posts or public talks.

This was inspired by thoughtbot’s [synonymous project](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), of which we failed to come up with a better, simpler name for what we do on a daily basis.

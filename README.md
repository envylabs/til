Quick notes on daily discoveries that can be code or program-related. These things happen on a daily basis, but usually fail to be recorded anywhere beyond office conversations and internal show-and-tells.

This was inspired by thoughtbotâ€™s [synonymous project](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), of which we failed to come up with a better, simpler name for what we do on a daily basis.

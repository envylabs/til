# Export from Sketch

With an artboard selected in the right panel, you can select export options from the left. These become the default export options for all artboards when you select **File > Export…** .

Also of note: if you don’t have these set, or have them set to anything other than PNG, I believe InVision will ask for you to upload fonts when you throw a .sketch file into InVision.

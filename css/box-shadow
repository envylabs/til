# Box Shadow

In CSS, `box-shadow` only takes up the size of the element, and no more, not taking into account blurring. Example: http://codepen.io/dangodev/pen/ZGzwdK

Itâ€™s beginner knowledge, sure, but this was the first time I really pushed the upper limits of `box-shadow` to learn this. Beyond the normal 1 & 2px subtle shadows.
